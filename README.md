# silver_martians
Off into the space,
exploring the Saturn's ring,
and on the way back home,
got a singal from our neighbourly red planet.
Have to choose your path,
with low supplements to barely last,
to live wondering or die exploring.

## Flutter Feb Day 2 Session in brief :
* Asset Accumulation
* First Screen
* Making the Button Work
* Navigator.push
* Make the second screen
* Make a dummy route to see the second screen
* Make a route generator that uses enum to generate properly configured routes
* Make the last screens and complete the game with Navigator.pop()
